#### Proxy pattern  
class functioning as interface to something else  
proxy can forward to the real object  
when operation on real object is resource intensive  
we could cache results in proxy objects to save accessing real object  
or checking pre-conditions before operations on real object invoked  

clinet's usage of proxy is same as real object, both implement same interface  

#### DI dependency injection or Inversion of Control IOC  
technique to delegate instantiation of dependecies to the IOC container  
instead of doing it in our own code
